title: "Batchnormalization is not a Norm!"
subtitle: "Questioning the usage of fundamental elements in a CNN"
summary: "This article discusses different types of normalizations in a Convolutional Neural Network and why Batch Normalization is necessary. There is an experiment that involves random dropping of BatchNorm Layers based on a hyperparameter in an Object Recognition model and validating it across the accuracy."
